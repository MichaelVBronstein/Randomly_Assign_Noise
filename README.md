Randomly_Assign_Noise
=====================

This repository contains the code necessary to create and administer a task which has been shown to alter the amount of neural noise (entropy) in a subject's brain. Thus, one can use this code for the purposes of studying the effects of such alterations and for testing theoretical models of the effects of noise. 

The image files needed to use the code in this repository are not included, but are available upon request by contacting bronsteinm15 [at] mail.wlu.edu.
